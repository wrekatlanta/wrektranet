Hey!

WREK will gradually begin using Google Apps for email and documents, and active staff members will need to setup these new accounts in order to use WREKtranet 2.0 (updates on that coming soon).

Your username is: <%= @user.username %>@wrek.org
Your temporary password is: <%= @password %>

Please login at https://mail.google.com with these credentials and change your password as soon as you can. Other than that, your names and phone numbers have been migrated, and WREKtranet will provide a way for you to change your contact information in the future.

We will not begin using the Gmail functionality until most likely the spring semester, but we need everyone to help with this gradual transition.

Let me know if you have any questions or run into any problems!

Patrick Stoica
IT Director
